# Cloud Dataflow

  - Managed data processing service

  - cloud version of Apache Beam (Beam comes from Batch + Stream)

  - An advanced unified programming model to implement batch and streaming data processing
    jobs that run on various execution engines/runners

  - Serverless, fully managed

  - Horizontal autoscaling of worker

  - jobs can be created:
    * using a pre-defined template
    * using a notebook instance
      - write data pipelines in Java, Python, SQL
    * from Cloud Shell/Local machine

## How Dataflow Works

  - Write jobs in Java, Python, Go

  - Unified API for both batch + stream processing
    * no need to separately handle batch & streaming data

  - Execution
    * Direct Runner
      - Scaling issue
  - Apache Flink
  - Apache Spark
  - Cloud DataFlow
