# Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

## Vertical scaling

  - improve the hardware of your current machine
    * ex: upscale 8vCPU-16GB RAM machine to a -> 12vCPU 24GB RAM machine

## Horizontal scaling

  - increase the number of nodes (machines) to run the application
    * ex: scale a infraestructure from having 1 8vCPU 16GB RAM machine to having 8 8vCPU 16GB RAM machines
