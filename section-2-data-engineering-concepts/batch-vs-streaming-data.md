# Batch vs Streaming Data

## Batch

  - Defined start & end of data. data size is known

  - Processing high volume of data after a certain periodic interval

  - long time to process data

  - example: processing high volume data every Monday.

## Streaming

  - Unbounded, no end defined.

  - data is processed as it arrives.

  - size is unknown

  - data processing is not very heavy, taking milliseconds/seconds to process data.
