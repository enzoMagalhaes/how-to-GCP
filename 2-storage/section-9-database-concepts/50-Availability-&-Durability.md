# Availability & Durability

## Durability

  - if you loose data means
    * business is down
    * no business can afford to loose data

  - How healthy & resilient your data is

  - object storage provider measure durability in terms of number of 9's
    * example: 99.999999999% - *11 9's*

    *  that meand that even with one bilion objects, you would likely go
       a hundred year without losing a single one!

## Availability

  - if region goes down where your data is stored
    * replicate data across many regions

  - how much time your data is up/available to access

  - data replicated across multiple regions, means higher availability

  - SLA: service level agreement

  - SLA - 99.99% : 4 9's
